INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO SET UP THE MONTHLY TRIGGER

Once a month trigger for events/scripts/etc.

Made by Gunnar Von Pontius for Minutes to Midnight

###################################################

The "effect" is achieved by using decisions that has effects in it, triggering the monthly effect script.

First of all; set up the following command as a on_startup in the 00_on_actions file.

####
on_startup = {
	effect = {
		set_variable = { amount_of_pulses_passed = 0 }
		XXX = {
			set_country_flag = pulse_january
		}
	}
}
####

The "XXX" country tag here is used for whatever the least used/dummy nation you have is.
As no one in MtM ever plays Malaya it has the MAL tag.
This sets the flag necessary for "XXX" to start the chaining decisions needed for the pulses.

After this is complete, add the decisions file to your decisions folder, and the following into your decisions_categories file.

####
pulse_actions = {
	icon = generic_propaganda

	visible = {

	}
}
####

When this is complete; add the MtM_pulse_effects file into the scripted_effects folder.
The code looks like this:

####
first_every_month_script = {
	add_to_variable = { amount_of_pulses_passed = 1 }
	USA = {
		US_current_desegregation_level_monthly_change_script = yes
	}
}
####

In MtM this triggers a monthly script for the us (kept as an example, remove for yours. This is where you add in the effects you want.

Keep the "add_to_variable = { amount_of_pulses_passed = 1 }" since with the var_list command you can check how often the effect has been triggered.
Make sure that you make each thing country specific, as otherwise it will run on your XXX nation.

Lastly, replace the MAL tag the pulse_decisions file with whatever TAG you have choosen.

Now it is complete, and if you have done the above it will work.
